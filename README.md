# Gas-Detection-Ventilation-System

The goal of this project is to design and implement a system for monitoring the gas leaks or other emissions and informs the user in real time about air quality. In case of emergencies, the user can power on a ventilation and/or irrigation system, in order to remove the threat.

In order to achieve our goal, we will use an Arduino UNO board and some compatibles modules 	specific to the problems encountered in creating the system. The software used is the Arduino IDE.
